== README

This is my first RoR application created in the Team Treehouse course.
It is basically a todo application.

You can:

* Create a todo list

* Edit a todo list

* Delete a todo list

* Add new items

* Mark the items as completed

It's finished (according to course), however I think I should work a little bin on css here.
